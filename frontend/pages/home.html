    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 mb-4">

      <li>Your speech is recorded, transcribed, and analyzed.</li>
      <li>An emotion vector is calculated and displayed as an intensity bar.</li>
      <li>An AI friend generates a thoughtful response that is displayed and spoken back to you.</li>
